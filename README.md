#  Oracle Hanabi Live Bot WIP!

### Description
**Oracle** is an intelligent bot for playing Hanabi on the **hanab.live** platform. Unlike simpler bots that rely on basic heuristics, this project is built with a modular architecture that allows for the easy integration of complex, "smart" strategies. The goal is to create a bot that can serve as a reliable and intelligent partner for automated gameplay.

### Features
* **Modular Architecture**: The project is split into logical components (services, strategies, managers) to simplify development and testing.
* **Flexible Configuration**: It supports running multiple bots simultaneously, each with a different strategy. Configuration is loaded from `config.toml` and `.env` files.
* **Robust Connection**: A built-in automatic reconnection mechanism for the WebSocket server ensures stable operation.
* **Dynamic Strategy Loading**: New strategies can be added as separate files, and the bot will automatically detect and load them without requiring changes to the core code.
* **Event-Driven Model**: An **event bus** (`EventBus`) allows components to communicate with each other without needing to know about their internal implementations, making the system highly flexible and scalable.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/antowkas/oracle-hanabi-live-bot.git
    cd oracle-hanabi-live-bot
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

3.  **Configure your bots**:

    Create a `config.toml` file in the root directory and specify the bot parameters. Each bot requires a `username` and a `strategy`.

    *Example `config.toml`:*
    ```toml
    [[bots]]
    username = "OracleBot1"
    strategy = "SimpleStrategy"

    [[bots]]
    username = "OracleBot2"
    strategy = "MyCustomStrategy"
    ```

    Create a `.env` file to securely store passwords. Passwords are dynamically loaded using the format `username_password` (in lowercase).

    *Example `.env`:*
    ```env
    oraclebot1_password=my_secret_password1
    oraclebot2_password=my_secret_password2
    ```

4.  **Run the bot**:
    ```bash
    python -m oraclehlb.main
    ```

### Creating a Custom Strategy

1.  Create a new file in the `oraclehlb/ai/` directory, for example, `myawesomestrategy.py`.
2.  Create a class that inherits from `BaseStrategy` and implements the `decide_action` method:
    ```python
    # oraclehlb/ai/myawesomestrategy.py
    from oraclehlb.ai.base import BaseStrategy
    from oraclehlb.models import GameState

    class MyAwesomeStrategy(BaseStrategy):
        async def decide_action(self, state: GameState):
            # Your decision-making logic goes here
            ...
            return {"type": "play", "orderID": 123}
    ```
3.  Add your new strategy to the `config.toml` file:
    ```toml
    [[bots]]
    username = "MyAwesomeBot"
    strategy = "MyAwesomeStrategy"
    ```
The project will automatically load your new strategy when you run it.
